# Operating System

Arch Linux with BSPWM Tiling Window Manager.

# Terminal

- **Kitty**: Just a terminal emulator with images and Unicode support.

# Shell

- **zsh**: I use zsh as a shell, because of features like plugins, spelling correction, and approximate completion. I don't mind using other shells though, as on my server I use bash.

  I only use vanilla zsh, with my [configs](https://github.com/prateekpunetha/dotfiles). I don't use oh my zsh because it is slow and has unnecessary stuff which I don't need.

# Text Editing & Programming

- **vim/Neovim**: vim is a incredibly powerful and efficient text editor. The amount of stuff I've done in record time using vim is staggering.

# Web Browser

- **Brave**: A FOSS, chromium-based web browser with the ability to block ads and trackers by default.

# File Manager

- **ranger**: I mainly use ranger for just looking up files and bulk renaming. For operations like move, copy, etc. I use unix command utilities.

# Image Viewer

- **sxiv**: A hacker-friendly scriptable image viewer. It also supports animated GIFs, thumbnails, and slideshows.

# Document Viewer

- **zathura**: zathura is a minimal yet highly customizable plugin-based document viewer. If you want to make it read pdf, you'll need a plugin for that and the same goes for other types of doucments like ps, epub etc.

Previously I usedÂ to use xreader, but now I've switched to zathura, because it just works
the way I [want](https://github.com/prateekpunetha/dotfiles/blob/master/zathura/.config/zathura/zathurarc)
it to be.

# Media Player

- **mpv**: Neat and simple interface video player which works perfectly with a wide variety of video formats and has all the customizations I need.

- **Celluloid**: A really good front-end for mpv.

# Email

- **neomutt**: Simple yet powerful terminal based email client.

# Sync

- **syncthing**: Serverless device syncing.

# RSS

- **newsboat**: A simple RSS feed reader for the terminal.

# Other

- **aria2**: It is a all-in-one downloading tool. I use it for torrenting and downloading files from other websites.

- **ffmpeg**: General purpose command-line tool for video and audio recording, and conversion. I mainly use it for adding subs to video files, concatenation, and cropping.

- **ImageMagick**: I use it to edit, convert, resize or rotate images.

- **rclone**: Command line program for managing files over cloud storage. Yes, a Swiss army knife of cloud storage.

- **youtube-dl**: CLI tool for downloading youtube videos. Can download youtube playlists or even an entire youtube channel. It also supports downloading from many other [websites](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html).
  Technically, I use [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp) these days, because it has some additional features and it also fixes problems like buffering with mpv that I face with regular ytdl.
